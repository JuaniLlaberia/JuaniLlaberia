### My technologies⚡

I primarily work with JavaScript and TypeScript, both on the front-end and back-end. I use frameworks like React and Next.js for the front-end and Express.js for the back-end. I'm comfortable working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, adapting to the needs of each project. Learning new technologies excites me and keeps me motivated every day to keep pushing forward.
